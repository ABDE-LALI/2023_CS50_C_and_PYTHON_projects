Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: TODO
With a small number of simulations we have a small time and with a big number
of simulations we have a big time
Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: TODO
It seems like the predictions stabilized after about 10000 simulations
